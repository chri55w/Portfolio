<p style="text-align:Justify">Roadkill was developed during a 14-week semester in a team of 11 students; 5 Artists, 3 Designers, 2 Programmers and 1 Animator (Listed Below). Working in Unity3D with C# we successfully implemented a variety of features including basic racing mechanics, artificial intelligence and power ups. In the sections below I will discuss some of the features that I worked on.</p>

<br />
<p style="text-align:Left; font-weight:bold;">Driving Mechanics</p>
<p style="text-align:Justify">As the core mechanic of our game, smooth driving was the primary focus of development for the first few weeks. Much of the work in this area was pair-programmed whilst we attempted to find a technique that suited the game. The final implementation was inspired by the mechanics in the game Obilteracers, developed by Space Dust Studios.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG1CtlFRmpU">This short video</a> released by the developers guided us to the design that we required, once this was complete we could better separate the programming tasks and continue our development.</p>

<br /><br />
<p style="text-align:Left; font-weight:bold;">Bezier Spline Tool</p>

<p style="text-align:Justify">Part way through the project we realised that modular track pieces did not suit the style of game that we aimed to create. To help the designers in creating a smooth and easily maintainable track I developed a Bezier spline tool in the Unity Editor which extruded a mesh along the modified curve. This technique allowed tweaks and improvements continually throughout the development process and would drastically reduce the time required to prototype and develop new tracks.<br /><br />This development later became particularly useful in the driving mechanics of the AI agents, Lap positioning and resetting kart positions.</p>

<br /><br />
<p style="text-align:Left; font-weight:bold;">Menus & HUD Elements</p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/Roadkill/UI Elements.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
<p style="text-align:Justify">I also implemented a variety of UI Elements, such as the in-game HUD, including setup for multiplayer split-screen, and the setup menus which involved a multiplayer character selection screen, generic race setup and track selection.</p>
