<p style="text-align:Justify">Immobile Tanks works on a turn based system where a player competes against an AI agent in a top down tank shooting game. Each player has a limited fuel allowance and only one opportunity to fire on each turn. </p>
<br />
<p style="text-align:Justify">The player should modify the tilt angle of the barrel and the power value in order to aim their projectile to hit their opponent, the closer the shot the more damage dealt until the opponent is defeated.</p>
<p style="text-align:Justify">The development of the game was completed in XCode using Objective C and testing was completed on an iPad Mini (2nd Gen).</p>
<p style="text-align:Justify">Some of the core features that were implemented include; Gyroscope Input, Magnetometer Input, Accelerometer Input, Speech Input, Simple Touch Based Controls, Artificial Intelligence and Menus & Settings.</p>
