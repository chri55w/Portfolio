## Job Role
My role as a Junior Software Engineer (Placement) at Savantech focused largely on the development of C# applications driven by large SQL server Databases both for client projects and internal developments. I developed several WPF applications, a Windows Service Application and supported and maintaned a large ASP.Net web application. I was often in contact directly with clients throughout development processes and support calls during my full time contract.

<br/>
In my final year of university I moved to a part time role, during which most of my work was been focused on internal developments to imporove procedures and efficiency through improved software soloutions. My work in this area is still ongoing after switching back to a full time role and will continue until late August 2017.
